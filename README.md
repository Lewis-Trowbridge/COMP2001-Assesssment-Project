# IMPORTANT

The authentication API uses a hardcoded API key for demonstration purposes - for convenience, the value is **OTM4NDA5MjM3MDczOTA**.

## What is it?
This repository contains both the authentication API in the "Auth" folder, as well as the linked data application in the "Hospitals" folder (although it is confusing, the actual terminology in used in this application is "practices")
